# Project

This project uses React for the frontend and python Flask for the backend. The Riot api isn't accessible with calls to the frontend
and require a secret key in order to work, therefore flask is used to handle the api calls, package and send information back to the frontend.

The project allows you to search up any League of Legends username, select a region and show details of that players match history/level and etc.
